TA meeting:
So far we have set up a functioning website and login page and merged in database code
Need to add epics, user acceptance criteria, and other labels onto user stories in project board (lab 4)
Need to add release notes for each week before TA meeting (can be automated)
Everyone's commits/progress were satisfactory
At next meeting, have everything merged together to show one merged and functional program
